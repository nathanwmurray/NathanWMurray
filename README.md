I'm brushing up my fullstack skills with a myriad of fun little projects. I'm currently working in JavaScript, C#, Angular, .NET, CSS, and more.

When I'm not coding I'm probably working on learning Unreal Engine 5 and Blender because I think it would be fun to build an indie game! 

During my screen breaks, I'm probably training for my next race as I try to build up to Ultramarathon distance or building a campfire in the
middle of the woods.

I believe that there's always more to learn, always further you can go, and always new records that you can beat!
